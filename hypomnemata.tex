\section{Phonology}

Illegal clusters may occur in particular grammatical contexts, and
thus look common (\textit{cf.} Latin \LL{-nt} in \I{3pl} verb
endings).

% http://www.unish.org/upload/word/사본%20-%20MarkVanDam%5B1%5D.pdf
Hierarchy of codas:\footnote{Some attested single-\I{c} coda
  inventories: \{n ŋ\}, \{n ŋ t k\}, \{n ŋ m p t k\}, \{n m l r\}, \{n
  m w j\}, \{n ŋ m l r j\}, \{n m r d\}, \{d l s x\}, \{m b k l z r\},
  \{n l w j t k\}, \{n ŋ m l p t k\}, \{w n m r k t v ʃ ʒ\}.} n < m,
ɳ, ŋ < ɳ << l, ɹ < r, ʎ, ʁ < ɭ, ɽ << t < k, p < s, z, c, q, ʃ < b, d,
g, x h << w, j.  There is a slight place hierarchy: alveolar < velar <
retroflex or tap.  Classes percolate, such that in complex codas, if
Nasals, Resonants and Stops are permitted you usually expect \I{n, r,
  s, nr, ns} and \I{rs} as coda sequences.  Other orders are possible,
but the above rule is common-ish.

Hierarchy of clusters (\I{s} = sonorant, \I{o} = obstruent), word
initial: \I{os} < \I{oo} < \I{ss} < \I{so}; word final: \I{so} <
\I{oo} < \I{ss} < \I{os}.  Onset clusters tend to avoid identical
places of articulation, which leads to avoidance of things like
\textit{*tl, dl, bw,} etc., in a good number of languages. /j/ is
lightly disfavored as \I{c2} after dentals, alveolars and palatals;
/j/ and palatals are in general disfavored before front vowels.

Languages with \textit{sC-} clusters often have syllabic codas.
s+\I{stop} < s+\I{fric} / s+\I{nasal} < s+\I{lat} < s+\I{rhot} (the
fricative and nasal are trickier to order).

Even if a particular \I{c} is a permitted coda, its allowed
environment may be quite restricted. Potential constraints: forbidden
before homorganic stop; or homorganic nasal; geminates
forbidden. Solutions: delete with compensatory vowel lengthening;
debuccalize (become fricative, glottal stop, delete without
compensation; nasal deletion with nasalized vowel remaining).

Lower vowels are preferred as syllabic nuclei; high vowels are more
prone to syncope (either midword or finally).  Content words less
likely to elide.
% https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/u26/publications/QP1FinalDraft.pdf

Sonority hierarchy:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent low vowels > mid vowels (except /ə/) > high vowels (except /ɨ/) > \\
\indent /ə/ > /ɨ/ > glides > laterals > \\
\indent flaps > trills > nasals > /h/ > \\
\indent voiced fricatives > \\
\indent voiced stops and affricates, voiceless fricatives > \\
\indent voiceless fricatives, voiced stops and affricates > \\
\indent voiceless stops and affricates
\end{quotation}

Vowel devoicing starts with lowest sonority  (/i/, /u/).

Hiatus resolution: 1) elide, contract, add glide /j/ or /w/; 2)
intrude /h/ or /ʔ/; 3) intrude /t/ or /r/.

Metathesis (where P = /p, b, m/, etc.).  Obstruent + resonant can
switch.  \I{pk} > \I{kp} occasionally, but not the other way.
\I{t\{pk\}} > \I{\{pk\}t} reasonably common.

% http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/phonlab/annual_report/documents/2007/Hyman_Phono_Universals_PL.pdf
Many things can happen to a consonant following a nasal: NT > ND; NS,
NZ > NTS, NDZ; NT > NTʰ; ND > NN; but also: ND > NT; NTʰ > NT; NN >
ND.

Some suffixes may occur only in pausa, or are different there.

\subsection{ATR Harmony}
Some systems are dominated by the feature of the word root, causing
harmony both to the left and the right. Other systems are based on
syllable position, \textit{e.g.,} a system where \I{-atr} vowels can
follow, but not preced, \I{+atr} vowels. An originally larger vowel
inventory may reduce, giving a situation where one apparent vowel can
trigger \I{+atr} in some words and \I{-atr} in others. Different
morphological systems may take different rules within one language.

May apply to all vowels, or just to \I{-atr} /ɪ ʊ/ (or /ɛ ɔ/).

/a/ may be transparent, or may block. Or may be \I{-atr}, with /ə/ the
\I{+atr} version.

Common systems: 9V /iɪeɛaɔoʊu/; 7V(M) /ieɛa(ə)ɔou/ or 7V(H)
/iɪɛa(ə)ɔʊu/. \I{-atr} usually dominant in 7V(M), \I{+atr} usually
dominant in 7V(H).

\subsection{Reduplication}
The \textbf{inflectional} uses inculde: number (for nouns; for verbs
marking actor number or event plurality; in noun compounds either or
both elements may reduplicate, sometimes in free variation); very
rarely to encode possession (either of 3rd person, or 1st and 2nd,
usually with partial reduplication); frequent in verbs for
frequentative, habitual or progressive aspect, but also imperfective,
inchoative and perfect(ive).

\I{red} may be used to repair a word shape that has taken some affix.

% http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.54.8895&rep=rep1&type=pdf
The \textbf{derivational} uses include: ordinal numbers from cardinal;
distribution (``3 each''); valency reduction in verbs, as well as
reciprocals (and mutuality in other word classes, ``face to face'');
diminutive (and both endearment and contempt); associatives (``someone
with X''); similarity; sort/kind of N; disposition (``someone prone to
X, likely to X''); common in indefinites (``who'' > ``whoever''); in
verbs, a lack of control, disorder, carelessness, pretense, attempt;
incrementality (``gradually, little by little, one by one'');
spread-out or scattered (``here and there, looking around'');
non-uniformity (``zig-zag, now and then, in several colors,
hodge-podge'').

Not infrequently used to name insects and birds, and the word for
``baby.'' 

Noun to verb (``to wear an X''), adjective or adverb; verb to noun
(agent noun, action noun, instrument), adjective or adverb; adjective
to adverb.

For adjectives and other vocabulary of quality: diminutive
attentuative, augmentative, intensification.

The sense of ``collectivity'' might be used where we would expect a
single term (``broom, flight of stairs,'' etc).

Some affixes may simply require the root take \I{red}, with Makah
having several types of \I{red} and affixes selecting one.


\section{The Noun}

Nouns are the most frequently borrowed word class.

\subsection{Possession}
``Possession'' can cover a wide range of relationships:

\begin{grammarlist}
  \item Ownership (or temporary possession)
  \item Whole-part relationship (body part, part of an object)
  \item Kinship
  \item Attribute of a person, animal or thing (``Bob's temper'')
  \item Orientation or location (``the front of the house''; useful
    when body part terms are used for location to use different
    marking)
  \item Association (``my teacher,'' but also dwellings, house to
    homeland, and personal clothing and goods)
  \item Nominalization
\end{grammarlist}

\noindent Most languages do not have the wide range of possessive uses
found in English or Greek in the same construction.  The first three
in the list above are most central.

Marking for inalienable possession is generally smaller (fewer
syllables, no classifier, simpler construction) than the marking for
alienable.

Genitive marked on R, pertensive marked on D.  Affixed possession
markers may also induce pertensive marking.  Genitive marking
frequently has other functions, pertensive rarely.

Different systems of marking may occur in two or even three groups
depending on possessor, pronoun, proper noun, kin term, common human
noun, common animate noun, common inanimate noun (with contiguous
constructions between groups).

Splits across whole-part D: external body parts, internal body parts,
genitalia, body fluids, parts of animals, parts of plants, parts of
artifacts. 

\subsection{Classifiers}

Number classifiers are most common with ``one'' and ``two,'' possibly
obligatory only with these; rarely with different classifier forms for
higher numbers.  More classifier types may be available with lower
numbers.

With stative verbs, the classic Dixon set are most likely to take
classifiers; or postural verbs.  With transitive verbs, more likely on
high-agency, high-patientness verbs (handling, cooking, killing and
the like).  With any verb class, optional classifiers may mark
salience or ``completeness'' of the classified feature.

When not used with their expected word class, classifiers may be
derivational.

\subsubsection{Gender / Noun Class}
Variable gender assignment may code size and/or shape and/or posture
(upright vs.\ horizontal).  Phonological gender assignment (initial,
final, or both, are possible determinates) typically restricted to
nonanimates.  Function of referent may change gender (water as drink
vs.\ water as part of the landscape).

Agreement: clefting may interfere or inhibit agreement; mixed class
resolution may default to the least marked form, but the behavior for
animate vs.\ inanimate may pick different forms, and coordination of
mixed animacy may simply be avoided altogether (a different
construction, or repeating the phrase with different subjects, etc.);
phonetics may inhibit some kinds of agreement.  Semantic agreement
override: attributive < predicate < relative < personal pronoun.

Different word classes may pick different genders for the least
marked, catch-all form.

It is rare but possible to have two noun class systems operating in a
single language, with different agreement rules operating on different
word classes.  In particular, ``pronominal'' agreement for pronouns
and verb agreement\footnote{Paumarí has m./f.\ for demonstratives, but
  a separate \textit{ka}/non-\textit{ka} agreement system on the
  verbs, showing up as a prefix.} and ``nominal'' agreement for
adjectives (and sometimes numbers).  Pronominal agreement in general
is focused on pronouns, is a smaller system, aligns with animacy, sex
or humanness, and have a fairly transparent semantic basis.  Nominal
agreement systems tend to be larger, focus on animacy, sex, shape and
size, and the semantics may be much less clear.  Demonstratives align
with either pattern, from language to language.  Where the two systems
have semantic overlap, the markers may be quite different, or cover
different spaces.

\subsubsection{Noun Classifiers}
Similar to gender, and historically may lead to it, but classifiers
are different.  The semantics are generally clearer; some languages
may allow cooccurance of classifiers (\I{specific general}, as in
``\I{human man} boy''); single \I{n} may take different classifiers to
determine precise meaning; may be used anaphorically (esp.\ across
clauses of a single sentence), possibly with other syntactic functions
(relative clauses).  Attend to coreferentiality.

May be small (2--3) or larger (20, or more).

``Social status'' may be encoded in human classifiers (``initiate,
known,'' etc.).  Some classifiers encode inherent nature (person, bug,
tree), some function (edible, drinkable, movable, etc.).  Multiple
classifiers will usually encode one of each.

Classifier on \I{n} may be omitted once class established, or
obligatory always.

May be separate \I{q} for ``unknown class'' vs.\ ``known class but no
more.'' 

Noun classifier systems often related to number classifier systems,
but they may be different.  Number classifiers are much less likely to
be optional.  Both systems may occur in a single \I{np}.

\subsubsection{Number Classifiers}
Sometimes there is a catch-all classifier, sometimes many nouns don't
take any classifier.

May not go beyond ten, or are dropped with 10s units.

Classifiers for humans/animates may have different forms with
different numbers; with low numbers the \I{n + cl} form can be
suppletive.

Affixed classifiers more likely to code animacy, and to be required;
independent classifiers code shape, consistency, etc., and may be more
or less optional, with different speakers at different competencies.
Rarely, affixed and independent classifiers may appear together.

A single noun may take different classifiers to focus salient
characteristic.

\subsubsection{Possessive Classifiers}
Can code: shape, consistence, animacy of possessum; relationship of
possessor to possessum (as in Oceanic indirect possession); or, very
rarely, class of possessor.

There may just be a bunch of words for ``of'' which match class
(possibly highly suppletive).

\subsubsection{Verbal Classifiers} 
Many originate from noun incorporation, possibly competing with it.
However, some verbal classifiers may be clearly related to numeral or
other classifiers in the language.  Another origin is from verbs, via
grammaticalized serial verb constructions.

Existential verbs may distinguish animate from inanimate; a few
languages elaborate existentials quite a lot (in a container, movable
vs.\ immobile, non-human animal, etc.).

\subsection{Case}
\I{sov} languages more likely to have case marking than \I{svo}.

\subsubsection{Allative} A huge range of possibilities here.
Occurring more often: true allative (``to, towards, reaching for''),
purpose (``use it for that, in order to''), conceptual (``think about,
occur to''), recipient (dative), timepoint (``at \I{time}''),
addressee (``talk to me''), perceptual (``look at, listen to''),
reason (``because of, ran from fear'').  Some less frequent
possibilities include: temporal boundary (``by/until \I{time}''),
benefactive, possessive, porportion or rate (``3 out of 4, 3 at a
time''), equivalence (``as, in exchange for''), subordinator
(``although, when, while''), emotional target (``hard for, be angry
at'').
% RiceKabata2007.pdf


\section{The Pronoun}

There may be separate forms for ``\I{prn} alone'' and/or ``\I{prn}
also'' unrelated to similar expressions for nouns.

Languages with 1/2 systems are not common, but not rare either.

Sg/du/paucal/pl is far more common that sg/du/trial/pl.

It's not especially common for sg and pl forms to be related (as in
Chinese).

Many languages:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  & Singular & Plural \\
\I{1st} & 1 & 12, 13 (and 11) \\
\I{2nd} & 2 & 22, 23 \\
\I{3rd} & 3 & 33
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

However, one might get something like:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
1 & 13 (and 11) \\
2 & 12, 22, 23     
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The basic 1/2/3 sg/pl system may be extended to include a special 12
``me and you'' form.  This may involve the innovation of a dual
throughout the pronoun system.  Or it may be just a normal system with
an inclusive/exclusive distinction.  Or a minimal/augmented system, 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Minimal & Non-minimal \\
1  & 1 + others \\
1+2 & 1+2 + others \\
2 & 2 + others \\
3 & 3 + others 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent The non-minimal may include ``unit augmented'' (one other
person, producing a dual in many forms) and just ``augmented'' (the
``plural'').  Minimal/augmented are common in Australia, Austronesian,
South America, and a few in North America, though the unit
augmented/augmented distinction is nearly restricted to Australia.

3sg = 3pl is a common neutralization.  2pl = 3pl (and 2du = 3du) can
happen.

Using 2du, 2paucal or 2pl as a mark of respect occurs in Europe,
Oceania, Australia.

There is a relationship between the indefinite ``someone'' and
1non-sg forms (French; Caddo, etc).  Usually it's 1pl.inc that does
this. 

Question-based indefinites may be marked with some other morpheme,
often related to words for ``be,'' ``want,'' ``perhaps,'' ``or'' or
``also.''


\section{The Adjective}
Comparatives neither rare nor universal.  Can be marked with (1) affix
and adpositional phrase; (2) adposition only; (3) coordination (``X is
big but Y is small'' = ``X is bigger than Y'').

Breaks along word class distinctions follow the adjective class: full
\I{nav} (all of noun, adjective and verb in the lexicon); \I{n[av]}
(i.e., property-concept words go with verbs); \I{[na]v}; and \I{[nav]}
(all three classes conflated).
% http://www.ualberta.ca/~dbeck/StJuste.pdf


\section{The Verb}

``Labile transitivity'' is very common.  Be clear on \I{s = a}
\textit{vs.} \I{s = o} for intransitive constructions.  Some languages
may skew in favor of one or the other, but others do not.  English
``cook,'' with transitive and both intransitives (``the chef cooks;
the chef cooks stew; the stew is cooking'') is unusual.

Lability is a dodge!  If the language has rich mechanisms for changing
transitivity, it's less frequent.

Labile verbs tend to cluster semantically, 1) destruction and strong
property change, ``break, boil, freeze, dry, go out, melt, dissolve,
burn, destroy, break, split, kill/die;'' 2) motion and spatial
configuration, ``rock, roll, sink, spread, close, open, connect,
rise/raise, stop, fill, turn;'' 3) phase, ``begin, finish;'' 4)
non-physical effect, ``change, improve, develop;'' and 5) verbs with
an animate patient, ``wake up, learn, gather.''  A single language may
pick several clusters, or only a few items from one.
% Letuchiy, A., "Interpreting the spontaneity scale."

A transitive verb may be used intransitively in an extended
intransitive sense, too.

Verb pairs (``die/kill,'' ``eat/feed'') for which the S/O role are
primarily animate are more likely to pattern with one basic
transitivity for the simplest stem (i.e., ``kill'' is primary with a
derivation for ``die''), while those with primarily inanimate S/O role
verbs (``boil/boil,'' ``burn/burn'', ``fall/drop'') will also have a
primary transitivity (in English, these are often labile or
suppletive).  In general, though, the basic role for animate verbs
will be intransitive, with augmentation for the transitive form.  On
the other hand, in the large, some few languages are fairly
intransitive, some quite strongly transitive.

Among other categories, some languages have verbs that mark ease or
difficulty.  The marking for ``ease'' on a transitive verb may signal
a small \I{o}.

In richly marked verbs, these may not be marked: \I{3rd} inanimate
sobjects, all \I{3rd} objects, \I{3rd} topical subjects, \I{3rd}
absolutives, all \I{3rd} of any kind.


\subsection{Affix Order}
The fewer person markers there are, the more likely they are to be
prefixing.  But: object marking on the verb is prefixing with more
than chance frequency.  Prefixing in general is less common with
\I{ov} than with \I{vo}, except for object marking, with a distinct
preference for object prefixing with \I{ov}.
%http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/fileadmin/material/40-60-puzzles-for-krifka/pdf/cysouw.pdf

If \I{t} and \I{a} are on the same side of the verb, \I{a} is closer;
if different, the order is \I{t Verb a}.

\subsection{Passive} Most often synthetic, with the marking usually,
but not always, closer to the verb stem than \I{tam} marking.

If auxiliary, most common intransitives are \textit{be, become,} and
verbs of motion; most common transitives are \textit{get, receive,
  suffer, touch;} even \textit{eat} is attested.

Accessibility in promotion of passive: \I{direct object > indirect
  object > adjunct}.

Actor most often represented by an oblique: instrumental, locative
(preposition, \textit{by}, ὑπο, etc.), genitive.  Rarely, a special
marking is employed.

\subsection{Semantic Types and Their Frames}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\I{affect} (\E{hit, cut}) & Agent & Target & Instrument \\
\I{giving} (\E{give, lend}) & Donor & Gift & Recipient \\
\I{speaking} (\E{speak, tell}) & Speaker & Addressee & Message & Medium \\
\I{thinking} (\E{consider}) & Cogitator & Thought \\
\I{attention} (\E{see, hear}) & Perceiver & Impression \\
\I{liking} (\E{like, love, hate}) & Experiencer & Stimulus
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In some languages, an \E{affect} verb may require an inanimate agent,
usually specific, such as food making a person sick, \textit{etc}.

In very few languages are \I{liking} verbs like \I{annoying} verbs,
where the experiencer and stimulus are in \I{o} and \I{a} roles.
However, extended intransitives, with an oblique experiencer, are a
bit more common.

\I{attention} and \I{liking} may have extended intransitive frames.
Or dative subjects.  Or oblique objects.

\I{want} verbs may have extended intransitive frames.

The types with more than two arguments may have lexical or
construction splits to determine which of the arguments is in the
primary \I{o} slot (``tell'' vs. ``speak (French)'' vs. ``say'').

For \I{give} there may be i) single verb with different constructions,
ii) gift role is always in \I{o} function, iii) recipient role always
in \I{o} function (rare; amusingly, with \I{dat} for the gift role).
Or, ii and iii may have different lexical items.


\section{The Adverb}
In languages otherwise without a well-defined adverb class, or a
regular way of forming adverbs, there may be root adverbs for the
domains \I{speed} (``quickly, slowly'') and \I{value} (``well,
poorly, bad''). In addition to root adverbs, these can show up as
derivations from adjectives which may differ from other adverb-like
constructions somehow (such as being zero-marked). These two semantic
cores are rarely the only one in any particular language.
%http://www.ling.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.99116.1346331417!/menu/standard/file/Hallonsten_Halling_Pernilla.pdf


\section{Number}

The distinction between ``paucal'' and ``plural'' is context
dependent. 

In a small number of languages the unmarked noun is collective, with
separate marking for singulative and plural.  Or, a few nouns might be
like that (\textit{cf.} Welsh).

If there is a trial, its use may signify salience of the number, with
the plural being used for three much of the time.

Number suppletion in verbs: not common, aligns ergatively.  Usually
only 1--4 verbs take it, but may reach a couple dozen.  If there is a
sg/du/pl distinction, at least some verbs will just have sg/pl (or
non-pl/pl).  Among intransitives, the posture verbs are most commonly
suppletive, \textit{sit, stand, lie,} and most likely to show numerous
number distinctions (du).  Next: \textit{enter, go, be big, die/be
  dead, hang, arrive, run, come, fall, cry, be little}.  Transitives:
\textit{kill, put/place, throw, give, break, take, bring, carry}.


\section{Constructions}

Any schematic construction may, like lexical constructions, be
polysemous.  For example, the English ditransitive:

\begin{grammarlist}
  \item \I{X causes Y to receive Z} (central sense), ``Joe gave Sally
    the ball.''
  \item Conditions of satisfaction imply \I{X causes Y to receive Z},
    ``Joe promised Bob a car.''
  \item \I{X causes Y not to receive Z}, ``Joe refused Bob a cookie.''
  \item \I{X acts to cause Y to receive Z} at some future time, ``Joe
    bequeathed Bob a fortune.''
  \item \I{X enables Y to receive Z}, ``Joe permitted Chris an
    apple.''
  \item \I{X intends to cause Y to receive Z}, ``Joe baked Bob a cake.''
\end{grammarlist}

Similarly, a particular language may have one construction for a
particular job, such as a ditransitive construction, but others have
several with different pragmatic or pivot significance (``I gave him
the book'' \textit{vs.} ``I gave the book to him'').

The non-ergative clauses in so-called split ergative systems are
rarely nom-acc (\I{a = nom, p = acc, s = nom}).  Instead one can get
\I{a = abs, p = abs, s = abs} (common), \I{a = abs, p = obl, s = abs}
(common) or even \I{a = erg, p = abs, s = erg} (common in Mayan).  The
aspect splits often reflect (historically) intransitive \I{aux}
constructions.  Thus, in rare circumstances, one may get splits in
future clauses, or with negation, if they reflected an original
\I{aux} construction.

\subsection{Complement Clauses}
These come in three types.

1.  Fact type, indicate that something did take place.  Similarly
marked to main clause.  If subject is the same across clauses, it
isn't likely to be omitted.  Usually marked with some complementizer
element which will have other functions in the language (often ``say''
or ``be like'').  Complementizer may code reliability (sure fact
vs. possible fact).

2. Activity type, indicating extension in time.  Often similar to a
noun phrase, but will still have a subject.  If the subject is the
same, it may be omitted.  Or the verb may have a special form.
Generally less specified in TAM and negation than a main clause; may
not include same bound pronominal elements.

3. Potential type, typically less like a main clause than the Fact
type and less similarity to a NP than the Activity type.  In some
languages, the subjects must be the same.  Reduced TAM and pronominal
marking.  Implicit type reference to same or posterior time.
Generally a special verb form (``infinitive'') or may take marking
similar to dative or some other case.

Languages may range from one to 5--7 complement types, with subtypes.

Attention verbs (``see, hear, show'') typically take Activity
complement.  May take Fact, for completed actions or of state.
``Find, discover'' are expected to take Fact.

Thinking verbs (``think (of, about, over), consider, imagine'') take
Fact, or sometimes Activity (``think about'').  ``Assume, suppose''
take Fact.  ``Remember, forget'' take Fact, with English unusual in
taking potential (``I remembered to shut off the stove'').  ``Know,
understand'' take Fact or Poetential.

Deciding (``decide, resolve, choose'') take Fact or Potential.

Liking (``love, prefer, regret, fear'') take Activity or sometimes
Fact.  ``Enjoy'' takes Activity.

Speaking has several subtypes.  ``Say, inform, tell'' usually take
Fact.  ``Report'' takes Fact or Activity.  ``Describe, refer to''
takes Activity.  ``Promise, threaten'' takes Potential, which may be
in the indirect object slot.  ``Order, persuade'' generally take
Potential. 

\subsection{Desententialization}

The most desententialized is purpose clauses: purpose $<$ before $<$
after, when $<$ reason, reality condition.  Also: phrasal, modal $<$
desiderative, manipulation\footnote{\textit{urge, suggest,} etc.} $<$
perception $<$ propositional attitude,\footnote{\textit{believe} and
the like} knowledge $<$ utterance.

\subsection{Negation}
Circumfix all over planet, just not common.

Possible distinctions, beyond simple ``not:'' noun vs.\ non-noun, verb
vs.\ non-verb (where adj.\ may pattern with either); different negator
for the future; prohibitive; participle negation; negative particle
for non-existence (which may be like ``no'' or plain negation for
nouns).  Non-verb negator can be grammaticallized from ``other,
different; refuse, not want.''


\subsection{Conditionals}

The protasis of a condition and formal marking of the topic may be
identically or similarly marked (including ``if X \I{adp}'' or the
like for topic marking).


\section{Lexicon}
Consider a few phonesthemes.

Diminutive/medial/augmentative may code gender of the speaker (Weining
Ahmao, in the classifier system).

Special formal/elevated vocabulary word shapes may have several
patterns of systematic relationship between it and base level words
(Javanese).

\I{vso} languages are more likely to have even noun-to-verb ratios
(lots of verbs derived from nouns), while \I{sov} languages are more
likely to have \I{n+v} idioms taking up the slack, resulting in more
nouns.  This includes \I{svo} languages that lean \I{ov}.  Regardless,
there are almost always more nouns than verbs (though perhaps not by
many).

Respect forms may contain morph for ``lord'' or ``sky.''

Some Austronesian languages have an ``anger'' vocabulary, not
swearing, for verbs and nouns.  Some common deformation patters.

Hunting, fishing or territorial languages: to conceal your intent from
animals or spirits, or with tabu considerations; circumlocution and
non-systematic deformation common practices for this.

Body parts become special concepts in stages: 1) a region of the human
body, 2) a region of an inanimate object, 3) a region in contact with
an object and 4) a region detached from the object.  The landmark path
(``extremity, peak'' $>$ ``head'') goes in reverse.

\section{καὶ τὰ λοιπά}

In Kolyma Yukaghir there is a separate \I{acc} just for use on \I{1/2
  sg/pl} when the subject is \I{1/2 sg/pl}, the ``pronominal
accusative.'' 

Form dependency: each element's forms may depend on choices made in
the feature above them (such as fewer tense forms in the negative, for
example).  The final three are potentially interdependent, polarity
$<$ tense, aspect, evidentiality $<$ person, reference classification
(gender, etc.) $\Leftrightarrow$ number $\Leftrightarrow$ case.

Hierarchy of diminutives and augmentatives: noun $<$ adj., verb $<$
adv., numeral, pronoun, interjection $<$ determiner.  These markers
may be distributed over several words in a sentence.

If the noun takes prefixing morphology, so will verbs.
