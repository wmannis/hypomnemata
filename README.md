# Hypomnemata Glossopoetica

This is a very terse collection of notes to myself about things I find
useful to remember or think about when constructing a new language.
It's less about rules and more about reminders of possibilities.
Probably some of it will not be very useful to anyone who doesn't
think very much like I do, but good chunks should be generally useful.

The section on sound changes is largely from the *Index Diachronica*,
but some items from other sources have made their way into it over
time.

## Building

You will need [The Brill](https://brill.com/page/BrillFont/brill-typeface)
typeface (or change it to some other Unicode and IPA capable font in
the LaTeX source, such as Libertinus).

You will need XeTeX (part of LaTeX).

```shell
xelatex hypomnemata
```
